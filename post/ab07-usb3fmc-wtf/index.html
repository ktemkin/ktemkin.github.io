    <p>I've written a bit about my look at &ldquo;commercial off-the-shelf&rdquo; USB3 PHY boards; and have been
taking a look recently at the <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Design-Gateway/AB07-USB3FMC?qs=5aG0NVq1C4wWGaHs8Oqcww%3D%3D">Design Gateway AB07-USBFMC module</a>. It turns out that my unit has what seems to be a pretty
embarrassing defect.</p>
<p>I've been testing my in-progress USB3 gateware with this PHY; and I've been running into an
interesting issue: periodically, some of the raw values sent were off by a single bit.</p>
<p>When training a USB3 link, one of the data sequences exchanged looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span> 4A 4A 
4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 
</code></pre></div><p>When using the AB07-USBFMC, trying to send this pattern resulted in the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span> 0A 4A
0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A
</code></pre></div><p>This is interesting for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This PHY has geared inputs, and accepts two bytes of data at a time.</li>
<li>The incorrect values (<code>0A</code>) are off from the correct value (<code>4A</code>) by a single bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure enough, modifying the data packet to send <code>FF</code> instead of <code>4A</code> pretty clearly shows off that missing bit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">00</span> BF FF
BF FF BF FF BF FF BF FF
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, I assumed that I'd gotten the pinout incorrect; and that I'd been writing to the wrong pin &ndash;
but careful examination of the documentation and my FPGA I/O definitions suggested that I had things right.
This suggested it was time to check things on the physical layer.</p>
<p>The board in question looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/board.jpg"
         alt="The PHY board, which features a notable long span of resistors, neatly tucked in parallel."/> <figcaption>
            <h4>The AB07-USBFMC (slightly modified as detailed later).</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Notably, there's a long series of what look like termination / signal conditioning resistors present at
the PHY boundary &ndash; and it looks like there's about 32 in total; which would make sense: 16 for transmit,
and 16 for receive.</p>
<p>A quick probe verifies that these are ~50R resistors, which would make a lot of sense for series termination:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/50r.jpg"
         alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 47.5 ohms."/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Sure looks like a series termination resistor.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is excellent news, as it means that the signals are easily accessible without &ldquo;voiding our warranty&rdquo;,
which is a bit of a comfort when dealing with a rather expensive evaluation board.</p>
<p>So, as a next-step test, I had my FPGA squirt a 100MHz clock signal into every line on the transmit bus,
and probed the PHY side of one of those termination resistors:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_healthy.png"
         alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock."/> <figcaption>
            <h4>A nice, healthy wobble. AC coupled.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The frequency and amplitude of this signal are pretty in-line with what you'd expect: the amplitude corresponds
nicely to a decently healthy logic <code>1</code>. But how does the signal look on the problematic bit?</p>
<p>I adjusted the FPGA design so it only squirted a wave into the problematic bit; and probed in line until I found it:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_unhealthy.png"
         alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock."/> <figcaption>
            <h4>A *lot* less happy. Still AC couled for display.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ut-oh. This signal's looking a lot less happy &ndash; and a lot more attenuated. At approximately 500mV peak,
you'd be hard pressed to consider this a logic <code>1</code>, even if you gave it your very best squint. There's no way
this thing would have worked in a test environment &ndash; which makes it seem very unlikely that this board was, y'know,
tested.</p>
<p>This immediately made me suspicious of the termination resistor sitting next to it; and apparently for good reason:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/larger_50r.jpg"
         alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 396.0 ohms."/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Quite possibly the largest 50 立 I&#39;ve ever seen.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This resistor is quite clearly supposed to be 50 立. It's also quite clearly <em>not</em> 50 立, despite sitting cleanly
in the middle of a row of 50 立 resistors, and pretty much definitely the source of my problems.</p>
<p>So, naturally it's time to perform what I assume must be several hundred dollars worth of rework on this $1.65k board.
Luckily, I stock E24 0402s, so I had the resistor replaced with an appropriate value in no time.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/happier.png"
         alt="Oscilloscope display of a corrected waveform."/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Much happier. Note the amplitude.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With an appropriate value replaced, everything looks much happier &ndash; and everything works much more nicely.
Finally, our USB training sets look just the way they should:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/yay.png"
         alt="Analyzer display showing the correct value of our training set."/> <figcaption>
            <h4>A correct Training Set, at last.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I'm planning on reaching out to Design Gateway &ndash; to at least let them know that this is an issue on some boards.
I'll update this post if/when I get a reply.</p>
